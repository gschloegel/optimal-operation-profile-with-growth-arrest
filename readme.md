# Readme 

This is the code including all plots used in the master thesis "Designing an optimal operation profile of a fed-batch process with induced growth arrest". It includes all code and generates all figures used in the thesis.

The notebooks are intended to run in the correct order, as 01_yields_and_qm.ipynb and 03_qP.ipynb generates python objects, that are used in later notebooks.

In the scripts folder, is the python package that contains the models and plot functions for the models.

Under additional calculations, the derivation of equations using sympy can be found and the figures for the introduction are created.

With the pDNA_model.yaml file the used conda environment can be recreated.
